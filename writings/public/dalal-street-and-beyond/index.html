<p>Markets, business and policy are all driven by one thing - narrative. Welcome to The Narrative Podcast, the podcast where we break down the stories behind business, markets and policy. If you want to understand the world beyond the headlines, this is your space for insight, analysis and clarity. I am your host Kushal Juneja and in this episode - &ldquo;Dalal Street and beyond&rdquo; - we will discuss about the BSE, the NSE, the SENSEX and NIFTY indices, and also touch upon other major stock exchanges and indices around the world.</p>
<p>Let us start with the BSE. The BSE (formerly known as the Bombay Stock Exchange) is Asia&rsquo;s oldest stock exchange, established in 1875 in Mumbai. That was 150 years ago! The BSE lists over 5000 companies across various sectors and has played a crucial role in developing India&rsquo;s capital markets.</p>

<p>The BSE also features the SENSEX, which is India&rsquo;s first and most widely tracked stock market benchmark.</p>
<p>The NSE (also called the National Stock Exchange) was established in 1992 as part of India&rsquo;s financial market reforms. The NSE lists more than 2000 companies across various sectors. It is home to the NIFTY 50 index, tracking India&rsquo;s largest 50 companies.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/eyhpy6l9pvnw8n3ch2x00/nse-top-10-companies-market-cap.xlsx?rlkey=o0x819i1dzw2ent4fqfdn5jdz&amp;st=lnm26mbc&amp;dl=0">Link to Excel</a></p>
<p>Both the BSE and the NSE are regulated by the SEBI (Securities Exchange Board of India).</p>
<p>It is interesting to note that India is not the only country in the world with multiple stock exchanges.</p>
<ul>
<li>The USA has NYSE and NASDAQ</li>
<li>Japan has Tokyo Stock Exchange and Osaka Exchange</li>
<li>China has Shanghai Stock Exchange and Shenzen Stock Exchange.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let&rsquo;s move to SENSEX and NIFTY. The SENSEX, short for Sensitivity Index, is the flagship index of the BSE. It tracks 30 of the largest, most actively traded companies of the BSE. It was launched in the year 1986. It is often referred to as &ldquo;The Barometer of the Indian Economy&rdquo;. Movement in the SENSEX is widely considered representative of the overall market sentiment.</p>
<p>The SENSEX index value as of 13th March 2025 is 73,828.91. It reached an all-time high of 85,836.12 on 26th September, 2024.</p>
<p><img src="https://gist.github.com/user-attachments/assets/40d03a2d-90bc-44ef-b129-8be10cf2b50e" alt="sensex_timeseries_annotated"></p>
<p>The current constituents of SENSEX are listed below. It is interesting to note that only 8 companies (those highlighted in yellow) continue to remain part of the index since its inception.</p>
<p><img src="https://gist.github.com/user-attachments/assets/8e47a50e-573c-4b33-8553-65245636e195" alt="sensex-constituents"></p>
<p><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/04zd2atphrl72e9xa4tw0/SENSEX-constituents.xlsx?rlkey=dabs4z7xox6783ge6zu8zcpar&amp;st=xslly81y&amp;dl=0">Link to Excel</a></p>
<p>The NIFTY 50 is the benchmark index of the National Stock Exchange. It comprises 50 of the largest and most liquid stocks listed on the NSE. It was introduced in the year 1996.</p>
<p>The NIFTY 50 index value as of 13th March 2025 is 22,397.20. It reached an all-time high of 26,216.05 on 26th September, 2024.</p>
<p><img src="https://gist.github.com/user-attachments/assets/44cf813d-5645-4c45-afda-a2ea2deb7208" alt="nifty50_timeseries_annotated"></p>
<p>The current constituents of NIFTY 50 index are listed below. It is interesting to note that only 12 companies (those highlighted in yellow) continue to remain part of the index since inception.</p>
<p><img src="https://gist.github.com/user-attachments/assets/3240cbc6-e5b0-4666-aac4-ab64e8917136" alt="nifty50-constituents"></p>
<p><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/nx2tuqhj9icmojy0dkw63/NIFTY50-constituents.xlsx?rlkey=07sqcaeiay80k9zf1w0g6riy1&amp;st=jvdn8oad&amp;dl=0">Link to Excel</a></p>
<p>If we compare the current NIFTY 50 and SENSEX constituents, Zomato is the only company that is part of the SENSEX but not part of the NIFTY 50.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s move from India to other developed capital markets across the world.</p>
<p>The USA has 2 major stock exchanges – the NYSE and the NASDAQ. And 2 major stock indices – SnP 500 and Dow Jones.</p>
<p>In Germany – the primary stock exchange is the Frankfurt Stock Exchange (FWB) and the stock index DAX tracks 40 major German companies.</p>
<p>In France – the primary stock exchange is the Euronext Paris (formerly called the Paris Bourse) and the CAC 40 tracks the 40 most significant companies listed on the Euronext Paris.</p>
<p>In Netherlands – the primary stock exchange is the Euronext Amsterdam (formerly called the Amsterdam Stock Exchange). It is the oldest modern stock exchange in the world. The AEX 25 tracks the 25 most traded Dutch companies.</p>
<p>Another interesting index is the EURO STOXX 50 -which represents performance of 50 largest companies from 8 Eurozone countries – namely – Germany, France, Netherlands, Spain, Italy, Belgium, Ireland and Finland.</p>
<p>Let’s move from the trans-Atlantic to the trans-Pacific. The primary stock exchange of Japan is the Tokyo Stock Exchange. The Nikkei 225 index is also called the Dow Jones of Japan. It is the price weighted average of 225 most significant Japanese companies. We also have the TOPIX – which takes all ~1800 companies listed in the TSE Prime and takes the market cap weighted average.</p>
<p>Finally, let’s move from nation states to a truly global perspective. The MSCI indices (Morgan Stanley Capital International). The MSCI provides indices that are used as benchmarks for global equity markets. For instance, the MSCI EM (Emerging Markets) index tracks large and midcap stocks across 24 EM countries.</p>
<p>This is a good place to conclude. In this episode, we covered stock exchanges in India and across the world. We also discuss many local and global indices that investors track to stay informed about the market activity. Thanks for tuning in to the Narrative Podcast!</p>
